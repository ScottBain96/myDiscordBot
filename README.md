<h1>Discord Bot created with Python</h1>

First the bot must be online, this is done by executing the Python file.
Once it is online, a message is displayed with the username of the bot and it's status (online) in the server:

Interacting with the bot is done with commands that follow a prefix (in this case I used '?').

Currently the bot has commands to:

Ask questions to the bot like an 8Ball game (?8ball + question)

Mute users, it will set them to a role of the server which doesn't have talking rights (?mute + username)

<img src= "images/pythonBot3.PNG" > 

Here you can see the user that was muted for testing purposes, his role is set to "Muted".

The reverse can also be done. (?unmute + username)

As you can see, the "Muted" role is reverted to None.
